    <h2 class="mb-3">About Atlas Competition</h2>
    <p class="lead fw-bold">Built by competitors. Engineered for the future of strength sports.</p>
    <p>
      Atlas Competition exists because the tools available to run strength competitions simply were not cutting it.
      Whether it was frustrating registration processes, paper scoring sheets, or the general chaos of event day,
      one thing was clear: the strength sports world deserved a better system. Not just slightly better. <strong>Radically</strong> better.
      Atlas was created to replace the outdated systems with something professional, intuitive, and reliable.
    </p>
    <p>
      At its core, Atlas is a full-featured platform that helps organizers create and manage strongman competitions
      with the efficiency and clarity these events demand. From building detailed event formats to enabling real-time
      scoring and text alerts, Atlas provides a powerful set of tools for running clean, transparent, and well-organized events.
      Athletes can register, track stats, and build a profile that represents their journey in the sport. Organizers
      can streamline check-in, customize divisions and weight classes, manage financials, and promote events confidently.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is not a stripped-down template or generic sports software. It was designed specifically for strength competitions
      by someone who lives and breathes the sport. Every detail was shaped by what actually happens on the contest floor.
      Atlas aims to professionalize the sport from the ground up, without losing the gritty, community-driven spirit that makes it special.

    <h2 class="mb-3">How Atlas Started</h2>
    <p>
      The idea for Atlas Competition didn’t come from a boardroom. It came from the back of a gym.
      From the experience of being a competitor tired of not knowing where to be, when to lift, or what the final scores were.
      From running events with a half-dozen tabs open and no reliable way to track registrations or assign athletes.
    </p>
    <p>
      I started building Atlas after years of competing in strongman events, watching athletes miss turns
      or leave without knowing how they placed, not due to lack of effort, but lack of tools.
      Atlas was born out of that frustration and grew into a platform that brings structure, visibility,
      and credibility to a sport that has always deserved more.

    <h2 class="mb-3">Meet the Founder: Blake Binford</h2>
    <p>
      My name is Blake Binford. I’m a strongman athlete and the founder of Atlas Competition.
      I’ve been immersed in this sport as a competitor, volunteer, and someone who genuinely loves the community.
      I’ve also spent over a decade building real-world systems in high-stakes industries like construction, energy, and compliance.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a competitor, I know what it feels like to show up to a competition that feels slapped together.
      As a business operator, I know how to build systems that last. Atlas is the result of both:
      lived experience, technical skill, and an unshakable belief that we can do better.
    </p>
    <p>
      I live in Texas, where I work in quality management for pipeline and industrial construction. I believe in building things that solve
      real problems, and that philosophy is embedded in every line of code inside Atlas.

    <h2 class="mb-3">Our Vision</h2>
    <p>
      Atlas isn’t just about technology. It’s about building a better future for strength sports:
      smarter competitions, cleaner logistics, more athlete exposure, and better tools for organizers.
      For federations and independents alike, we offer a platform that understands the sport and refuses to settle.
    </p>
    <p>
      We’re building more than software, we’re building infrastructure for a movement.
      Strength sports aren’t a fringe trend, they’re rising fast. Atlas supports that shift by helping everyone involved raise the standard.
    </p>
